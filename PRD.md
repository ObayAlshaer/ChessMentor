# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## **Product Name**
Chessboard Vision Analyzer

---

## **Objective**
To develop an iOS application that uses machine learning to analyze real-life chessboards, convert them into a digital representation, and suggest the best possible move using a pre-built chess engine API.

---

## **Key Features**
1. **Chessboard Recognition**:
   - Detect a chessboard from a static image or live camera feed.
   - Align and crop the chessboard accurately.

2. **Piece Recognition**:
   - Identify individual pieces on the chessboard, including their color and type.
   - Support standard chess sets.

3. **Move Suggestion**:
   - Analyze the current board state using a chess engine (e.g., Stockfish).
   - Suggest the best possible move to the user.

4. **User Interface (UI)**:
   - Display a live camera feed with an overlay guide for aligning the chessboard.
   - Provide move suggestions in an intuitive and visually appealing format.

5. **Offline Functionality**:
   - Perform image recognition and move analysis on-device without requiring an internet connection.

6. **Accessibility**:
   - Ensure the app is usable by individuals with varying levels of chess expertise.
   - Add features like text-to-speech for suggested moves.

---

## **Target Audience**
- Chess players of all levels (beginners to experts).
- Coaches and chess clubs for game analysis.
- Chess enthusiasts wanting a digital analysis tool.

---

## **Technical Requirements**
### **1. Core Features**
#### Chessboard Detection:
   - Framework: OpenCV (via Swift or Objective-C bridging).
   - Input: Static image or live camera feed.
   - Output: Cropped, aligned 8x8 chessboard image.

#### Piece Recognition:
   - Framework: CoreML.
   - Model: Fine-tuned MobileNet for classifying chessboard squares.
   - Input: Individual square images.
   - Output: Class labels (`empty`, `white_pawn`, `black_queen`, etc.).

#### Move Suggestion:
   - API: Integrate Stockfish chess engine.
   - Input: Forsyth–Edwards Notation (FEN) string.
   - Output: Suggested move (e.g., `e2 to e4`).

---

### **2. Platform Requirements**
- **OS**: iOS 15 or later.
- **Devices**: iPhone and iPad.
- **Frameworks**: SwiftUI for UI, CoreML for ML integration, and ARKit (optional).

---

### **3. Performance Requirements**
- Real-time chessboard detection and recognition (< 2 seconds per frame).
- Low latency for move suggestion (< 1 second).

---

## **Design Requirements**
### **User Interface (UI)**
1. **Home Screen**:
   - Buttons to start a new analysis, access settings, or view saved analyses.
2. **Camera Screen**:
   - Live feed with a square overlay to guide alignment.
   - Real-time feedback for board detection success/failure.
3. **Results Screen**:
   - Digital representation of the chessboard.
   - Best move highlighted visually (e.g., glowing squares) or using an arrow.
4. **Settings Screen**:
   - Options for enabling/disabling live feedback.
   - Language and accessibility settings.

---

## **Success Metrics**
1. **Accuracy**:
   - Chessboard detection: >95%.
   - Piece recognition: >90%.
2. **Performance**:
   - Average response time: <3 seconds.
3. **User Satisfaction**:
   - User rating: ≥4.5/5 on the App Store.

---

## **Project Timeline**
1. **Phase 1: Research and Planning (2 weeks)**
   - Dataset collection and analysis.
   - Define ML model architecture.

2. **Phase 2: Development (8 weeks)**
   - Implement chessboard detection and piece recognition.
   - Integrate Stockfish API.

3. **Phase 3: Testing and Optimization (4 weeks)**
   - Evaluate accuracy and performance under diverse conditions.
   - Conduct user testing and collect feedback.

4. **Phase 4: Deployment (2 weeks)**
   - Publish the app on the App Store.
   - Create documentation and marketing materials.

---

## **Constraints**
1. **Hardware Limitations**:
   - Ensure compatibility with lower-end devices.
2. **Dataset Requirements**:
   - Need a large, diverse dataset of chessboards and pieces.

## **Risks and Mitigation**
| **Risk**                      | **Mitigation**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Misalignment of chessboard    | Provide a guided square overlay for alignment.                                |
| Low piece recognition accuracy| Augment the dataset and fine-tune the model with transfer learning.           |
| Performance issues            | Optimize ML model (e.g., quantization) and preprocessing pipeline.            |
| Privacy concerns              | Perform all processing on-device; no images are uploaded to a server.         |
