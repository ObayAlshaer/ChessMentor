# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## **Product Name**
ChessMentor

---

## **Objective**
To develop an iOS application that uses machine learning to analyze real-life chessboards, convert them into a digital representation, and suggest the best possible move using a pre-built chess engine API.

---

## **Functional Requirements**
### **Core Features**
1. **Chessboard Recognition**
   - The system shall detect a chessboard from a static image or live camera feed.
   - The system shall align and crop the chessboard accurately.

2. **Piece Recognition**
   - The system shall identify individual pieces on the chessboard, including their color and type.
   - The system shall support standard chess sets.

3. **Move Suggestion**
   - The system shall analyze the current board state using a chess engine (e.g., Stockfish).
   - The system shall suggest the best possible move to the user in a clear format.

4. **User Interface (UI)**
   - The system shall display a live camera feed with an overlay guide for aligning the chessboard.
   - The system shall provide move suggestions visually and with text.

5. **Offline Functionality**
   - The system shall perform all image recognition and move analysis on-device without requiring an internet connection.

6. **Accessibility**
   - The system shall support text-to-speech functionality for suggested moves.
   - The system shall ensure the UI is intuitive for users with varying levels of chess expertise.

### **Platform and Device Compatibility**
- The system shall be compatible with devices running iOS 15 or later.
- The system shall support both iPhones and iPads.

---

## **Non-Functional Requirements**
1. **Performance**
   - Chessboard detection shall be completed within 2 seconds per frame.
   - Move suggestion processing shall have a latency of less than 1 second.

2. **Accuracy**
   - The system shall achieve a chessboard detection accuracy of at least 95%.
   - The system shall achieve a piece recognition accuracy of at least 90%.

3. **Usability**
   - The system shall provide real-time feedback on chessboard detection success or failure.

4. **Privacy**
   - All image recognition and processing shall be performed locally on the device. 
   - The system shall not upload images or user data to a server.

5. **Maintainability**
   - The codebase shall follow Appleâ€™s Swift coding standards.
   - The system shall support future integration of additional features like AR or multiplayer modes.

6. **Portability**
   - The system shall allow easy migration to new iOS versions with minimal changes.

7. **Reliability**
   - The application shall operate continuously without crashes during normal usage.

---

## **Target Audience**
- Chess players of all levels (beginners to experts).
- Coaches and chess clubs for game analysis.
- Chess enthusiasts wanting a digital analysis tool.

---

## **Design Requirements**
### **User Interface (UI)**
1. **Home Screen**
   - Buttons for starting a new analysis, accessing settings, or viewing saved analyses.

2. **Camera Screen**
   - Live feed with a square overlay to guide alignment.
   - Real-time feedback on chessboard detection.

3. **Results Screen**
   - A digital representation of the chessboard with the best move visually highlighted (e.g., glowing squares or arrows).

4. **Settings Screen**
   - Options for enabling/disabling live feedback.
   - Language and accessibility settings.

---

## **Project Timeline**
1. **Phase 1: Research and Planning (2 weeks)**
   - Dataset collection and analysis.
   - Define ML model architecture.

2. **Phase 2: Development (8 weeks)**
   - Implement chessboard detection and piece recognition.
   - Integrate Stockfish API.

3. **Phase 3: Testing and Optimization (4 weeks)**
   - Evaluate accuracy and performance under diverse conditions.
   - Conduct user testing and collect feedback.

4. **Phase 4: Deployment (2 weeks)**
   - Publish the app on the App Store.
   - Create documentation and marketing materials.

---

## **Constraints**
1. **Hardware Limitations**
   - The system shall operate on devices with minimal processing power (e.g., older iPhones).

2. **Dataset Requirements**
   - The system shall use a large and diverse dataset of chessboards and pieces to ensure accuracy.

## **Risks and Mitigation**
| **Risk**                      | **Mitigation**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Misalignment of chessboard    | Provide a guided square overlay for alignment.                                |
| Low piece recognition accuracy| Augment the dataset and fine-tune the model with transfer learning.           |
| Performance issues            | Optimize ML model (e.g., quantization) and preprocessing pipeline.            |
| Privacy concerns              | Perform all processing on-device; no images are uploaded to a server.         |
